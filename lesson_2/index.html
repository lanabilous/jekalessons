      <h1>What Are Essential Oils?</h1>
      <p>
        What are essential oils? Essential oils are the essence of a plant, a
        gift from the earth, distilled and prepared for you to bring the power
        of nature into your home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Essential oils give a plant its <mark>scent</mark>, protect it from
        hazardous environmental conditions, and even assist it with pollination,
        among other important functions and benefits.

      <h2>How Do Essential Oils Work?</h2>
      <p>
        When you open a <span>bottle of pure</span>, unadulterated essential
        oil, your senses are instantly filled with its potent aroma, even from a
        distance. What your nose detects are the naturally occurring elements of
        the essential oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every essential oil varies in its natural makeup, so aromas and benefits
        are also unique. For example, Lavender oil includes elements that make
        it effective for soothing skin irritations, and promoting a restful
        environment for sleep.
      </p>
      <h2>Use Essential Oils to Transform Your Life</h2>

        So many of the products we use in our day-to-day lives are filled with
        synthetic chemicals. These unnatural products can weigh us down and even
        negatively influence the way we think, feel, and live.<br />Pure
        essential oils offer an alternative to synthetic products. Essential
        oils are more than just natural products. Each with a unique chemical
        makeup, essential oils have dozens of benefits. Essential oil benefits
        are determined by the chemistry of the plants. If these natural
        chemicals are properly extracted, they can be used to help you in your
        daily life.
